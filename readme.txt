Transitions - 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
In this project you will follow step-by-step instructions to add animations to an existing static web page. 
The web page is an online reader; it presents the full text of the book "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" by Jules Verne.

The page for the first chapter is mostly complete. There are a few fancy features:

When you hover over the sidebar on the left, a menu opens which contains the Table of Contents.
When you hover over a highlighted word in the text, a definition appears. 
See the words "phosphorescent" and "locomotion".
When you hover over the semi-transparent buttons at the bottom of the page, they turn opaque.
When you hover over any link, it changes color.
These interactions add a level of refinement to an otherwise static page. 
Your job will be to refine them even more. Currently, all these changes happen in an instant. 
Add transitions to make the changes smooth.

The website's existing index.html and style.css files are displayed in the text editor.
